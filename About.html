    <p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MF_Doom" style="color:white" target="blank">MF DOOM</a>, born Daniel Dumile, is the greatest underground rapper the world has ever seen. Born in London, Dumile moved to Long Island, New York, at a young age. He began his career in 1988 as a member of KMD, performing under the name Zev Love X. 
        The group disbanded in 1993 upon the death of member DJ Subroc, Dumile's brother. After a hiatus, Dumile reemerged in the late 1990s, performing at open mic events while wearing a metal mask resembling that of Marvel Comics supervillain Doctor Doom, who is depicted on the cover of his 1999 debut solo album Operation: Doomsday. 
        He adopted the MF Doom persona and rarely made unmasked public appearances thereafter.
    
    Between 2003 and 2005, Dumile released four solo albums and three collaborative albums. In addition to the critically acclaimed Mm..Food (2004) under the MF Doom moniker, he released solo albums including one under the pseudonym King Geedorah and two as Viktor Vaughn. Madvillainy (2004), recorded with producer Madlib under the name Madvillain, is often cited as Dumile's magnum opus and is regarded as a landmark album in hip hop. In 2005, Dumile released The Mouse and the Mask with producer Danger Mouse as Danger Doom. His unique style of internal rhymes and double entendres earned him a special place in every hip-hop lover's heart. The mysterious Doom passed away on October 31st, 2020.
